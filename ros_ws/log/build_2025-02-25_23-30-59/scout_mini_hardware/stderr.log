[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:27 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findscout_mini_msgs.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "scout_mini_msgs", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "scout_mini_msgs"
  with any of the following names:

    scout_mini_msgsConfig.cmake
    scout_mini_msgs-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "scout_mini_msgs" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "scout_mini_msgs_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.
  If "scout_mini_msgs" provides a separate development package or SDK, be
  sure it has been installed.
